## About

#### Who 

Hello! I am PointyFar. I am new(-ish) to web dev and even newer(-ish) to Hugo. I like cats.

#### What 

This project lets you filter through Hugo themes by tags, license, and Hugo version. 

#### Why

I wrote this project because I wanted to easily filter Hugo themes using more than a single tag at a time.

#### Where 

Code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/pointyfar/hugo-themes-filter).

#### How 

I `git submodule`-d the [Hugo themes repo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes). A bit of `gulp`-ing produces  `data/themes.json` which I then use to extract data from.
